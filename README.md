# Cisecurity

Hi.

My name is Kenneth Karlsson and I am based in Västerås, Sweden.
I started my computer career with ICL mainframes and continued with DRSNX, Interactive Unix and Solaris.
Nowdays I mainly work with Linux, Windows and Macos.

The purpose of these scripts is to harden Ubuntu Linux systems.
cis1804.sh is based on CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.1.0 (draft) from www.cisecurity.org.
cis2004.sh is based on CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v1.0.0 from www.cisecurity.org.

Development started out as a test project for a large Swedish tech company but is now one of my hobies.

Executing this script without update mode (-u) will not make any changes to the operating system.
It will however indicate what would be done if run in update mode.

A computer specific file called .cisrc is created when executing this script for the first time.
Edit this file to adjust to server specific requirements.


A number of code snippets are based on the benchmarks from Cisecurity 

This software is still a work in progress and should not be run on production systems.
As I am not a professional programmer, any tips on how to improve the code will be appreciated.
